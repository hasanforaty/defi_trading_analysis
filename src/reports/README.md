    # Set data sources
    await report_gen.set_data_source("buy_waves", buy_waves)
    await report_gen.set_data_source("sell_waves", sell_waves)
    
    # Generate report
    report_data = await report_gen.generate()
    
    # Create charts
    chart_gen = ChartGenerator()
    wave_timeline = chart_gen.create_timeline(
        report_data.get("combined_waves", []),
        "start_timestamp",
        "end_timestamp",
        "transaction_type"
    )
    
    # Add chart to report
    report_data["charts"] = [wave_timeline]
    
    # Export to HTML
    exporter = ReportExporter("reports")
    report_path = await exporter.export_to_html(
        report_data,
        "wave_report",
        charts=report_data["charts"]
    )
    
    return report_path
```
